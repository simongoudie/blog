I recently updated my entry-level mid-2011 13" MacBook Pro to a nice new mid-2013 13" MacBook Air. I went with the 256Gb SSD version and bumped the RAM up to 8Gb and, so far, it's been a great machine. As with all new setups though, this needed a bit of customising as I setttled in and I thought I'd make some notes on what I put on, mainly for my own reference.

So, these are the details of the second setup of the Air - I say second, as the first thing I did was to try to setup the same triple boot as I had on the Pro (OSX, Windows 7 and Ubuntu). Bootcamp makes installing Windows easy, but there are still huge problems in completing the Ubuntu install on the new Air hardware and I ended up having to to a full disk erase and Mountain Lion recover by the end of the first day! I'll have to be content with just OSX and Windows for now.

At any rate, here's the software that made up the essentials for the new OSX install:

* **[Chrome]**: still the best browser for me, although I worry about the RAM usage over time
* **[Git]**: makes it easier to download and manage many other things, including...
* **[Dotfiles]**: keeping my dotfiles on GitHub makes it easy to move settings between machines. These aren't kept in the best shape, but there's enough in there to get me setup and comfortable on a new Mac. PC or Linux box. These files include settings, plugins and themes for zsh, vim and other utilities
* **[Vim]**: my editor of choice, so I use MacVim on OSX and plain old Vim on the command line
* **[XCode]**: command lines tools and homebrew: the basics of the toolkit
* **[Dropbox]**: keeps a lot of my files, including projects, photos, settings and so on, in sync between machines
* **[SuperDuper]**: for backing up to an external disk that's also partioned with a Time Machine instance
* **[Launchbar]**: my preferred launcher app, keeping my fingers on the keyboard
* **[Caffeine]**: keeps the screen on, useful when keeping an eye on the progress of all the downloads and installations going on
* **[Growl]**: I don't really use it to its potential, but it goes on to manage notifications
* **[PopClip]**: I'd be lost without this one, I cycle through extensions fairly often, but it's worth it for the clipboard actions alone
* **[1Password]**: again, I don't use it to potential, but it is the way I manage product keys and some passwords
* **[Sparrow]**: I worry for its future, but I still love it for email
* **[Moom]**: after switching from Windows a couple of years ago, I still have no idea what the green button does. Now it does what I want
* **[VLC]**: the omni-media player
* **[Office]**: unfortunately still necessary these days

Some nice tweaks that follow soon after:

* **[Bartender]**: tidy up an unruly menubar
* **[F.lux]**: make it all much easier on the eyes
* **[TotalFinder]**: I quite like what this adds to Finder, although it will be interesting to see what get duplicated in Mavericks
* **[TotalTerminal]**: I've tried using other termainal emulators, but I still like using TotalTerminal's visor mode, mapped to Control-~
* **[iTunes]**: logging in and setting up iTunes match, although Rdio gets most of my music listening currently
* Plus a [nice background] and at least two Spaces - one on the left for Sparrow/Twitter and one on the right for working. The dock gets sent to the bottom left of screen and autohides for maximum screen real estate

And then the rest of the apps that I use every so often:

* **[Evernote]**: still trying to work out where Evernote fits in my workflow, but I've ended up with a couple of years of Premium on my account all the same
* **[Transmission]**: for downloading those big... distros
* **[Steam]**: mainly for Civilization V and FTL
* **[Anvil]**: nice for local web experiments
* **[VirtualBox]**: usually for messing around with creating Linux servers
* **[App Cleaner]**: I think this is better for removing apps from OSX, but still not sure what best practice is
* **[Dash]**: a great way to check up on documentation
* Plus: **[Skype], [Day One], [iPhoto], [Cheatsheet], [Byword], [Coda 2], [Marked], [Pages], [Reeder], [Twitter], [Kindle]**

That's actually a pretty long list, it really doesn't feel like that when everything is set up and running! Dropbox and hosting some dotfiles on Github really make transferring settings a breeze and it doesn't take long from a fresh install to feel comfortable again.
