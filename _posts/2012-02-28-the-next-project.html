So the general idea of rebooting this blog is to track things that I'm learning and to keep myself honest by posting updates, questions, answers and interesting things that I find along the way. Given that the first entry was some Objective-C code, it should be no surprise that learning to program something functional is on the list of things to learn.

I guess that the best way to learn is to do, so the pet project to practise on at the moment will be a tracking app to keep track of things over time, the first use case will be to track what food the user eats and then how they feel later on. This is mainly because I often feel crap after eating and would like to find out what I shouldn't eat.

Continuing with the theme of learning transparently, I've put the starting files up as a new github repository and should be updating this on a regular basis as I work on it and learn new things. You can find the project  at: <del datetime="2012-03-21T12:07:34+00:00"><a href="https://github.com/simongoudie/FoodChecker" title="FoodTracker">https://github.com/simongoudie/FoodChecker</a></del> <a href="https://github.com/simongoudie/Tracking">https://github.com/simongoudie/Tracking</a>.
