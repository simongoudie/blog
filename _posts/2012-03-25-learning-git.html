In addition to learning the concepts and languages needed to write programs and apps, I also want to get a grip on as much of the surrounding ecosystem as I could. A very specific part of this is version control and version control systems. I chose to learn about Git because it seems like the most popular flavour at the moment and because GitHub is becoming such a key resource.
