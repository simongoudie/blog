Nothing much to post for now, as I haven't had much time to keep working on my projects. However, what I will say is that the WWDC session videos are great watching and are packed full of great information and explanations. If you have a developer account, it would be well worth the time to check out a few that relate to the systems you use. They can be found at [http://developer.apple.com/ videos/wwdc/2012/](http://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2012/ "WWDC 2012 videos") and are also available through iTunes U.
