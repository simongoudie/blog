Very happy with how easy it is to add email capabilities to an iOS app. Following <a href="http://mobile.tutsplus.com/tutorials/iphone/mfmailcomposeviewcontroller/" title="iOS SDK: Send E-mail In-App">the example given</a> at <a href="http://mobile.tutsplus.com/" title="Mobile Tuts+">Mobile Tuts+</a>, it was pretty simple to add an export function to my test app that now means users can have a csv file of their data emailed to them from within the app itself quickly and easily.

The process to prepare the csv file is still a bit of a mess and the whole process needs a bit of a tidy, but overall, it was a painless process.
