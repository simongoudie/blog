Very happy with how easy it is to add email capabilities to an iOS app. Following [the example given](http://mobile.tutsplus.com/tutorials/iphone/mfmailcomposeviewcontroller/ "iOS SDK: Send E-mail In-App") at [Mobile Tuts+](http://mobile.tutsplus.com/ "Mobile Tuts+"), it was pretty simple to add an export function to my test app that now means users can have a csv file of their data emailed to them from within the app itself quickly and easily.

The process to prepare the csv file is still a bit of a mess and the whole process needs a bit of a tidy, but overall, it was a painless process.

If you're interested in following along, the [Tracking app](https://github.com/simongoudie/Tracking "Tracking") is being maintained on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/simongoudie "Simon Goudie on GitHub").
