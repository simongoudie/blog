title: 'Rails: Trusting the magic'
---

I'm working my way through a couple of Ruby on Rails tutorials at the moment, looking at why this framework has gotten so much interest. In particular, [Michael Hartl's tutorial](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ "Ruby On Rails Tutorial") has been excellent. So far, things are going well and I have a nice little app coming together. However, the thing that gets me with such frameworks and helpers is the level of abstraction from what you are writing at any given time.

I don't know if it's just the way I work or not, but I'm most of the way through the tutorial series and I'm still struggling with the amount of 'magic' that Rails is doing on my behalf. While I can see the advantage of simply installing a few dozen gems and not writing a full framework from scratch, I can't help but be a little puzzled when the notion of database access or password hashing is hand-waved away by the framework. Writing tests, while a great way to develop, is likewise confusing and I'm still finding that the attempt to use a native-sounding syntax is more confusing than helpful. Differentiation between bracketing types \{\(\[\|\|\]\)\} is another puzzling aspect that I'm having trouble finding consistency with, something that I'm sure is to do with the way that the lower-level Ruby code is abstracted away.

So yes, I can see the benefits in using such a framework and I can see the time saved in bootstrapping an app, but there's only so much opacity that I feel comfortable with in a framework and, at this very early stage, Rails seems to be way over the limit. Hopefully, continued practice will make me feel more at home and I will be able to relax into it a bit more, trusting the magic to hold up in the end.
