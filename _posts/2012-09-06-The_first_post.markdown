This is the first post using Jekyll.

In time, I hope to put this up online somewhere it can be found, perhaps using Github pages. I've already created a repo and it is ready to go. I think it should be quite easy to put the files up there and start using it to serve the blog.

I even think that I'll have the chance to move away from WordPress if all goes well.
